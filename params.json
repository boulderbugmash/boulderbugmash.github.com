We break into pairs and mash bugs!!! A great way to try out pair programming and finding out how easy it is to get involved with open source. \r\n\r\nfaq\r\n\r\nI'm a beginner. Can I come?\r\nAbsolutely! You will probably notice things the experts won't because you're thinking differently about the problem. You'll pair with someone more experienced and it's really a lot of fun.\r\n\r\nwhat do we do?\r\n\r\nSchedule is 11-12 setup with getting everyone running the rails test suite on their machines. It's helpful if you have ruby and all the dependencies already installed. If you run into trouble we can help you out.\r\n\r\nLunch break 12-1\r\n\r\nMashing bugs until 5.\r\n\r\nThere's three main things that we look at. The first and easiest is looking at existing pull requests. We check to see if they apply cleanly, if they do what the author says they're supposed to, whether they have tests, and whether the behavior even makes sense to include the project.\r\n\r\nThe next thing we look at is reported issues that haven't been looked at yet. We try to reproduce the issue and if we can we try to submit a patch. This isn't always possible, but we know that in open source just showing you can reproduce an error is very helpful.\r\n\r\nThe third thing is finding issues that are either off-topic or too vague to reproduce and asking for clarification.\r\n\r\ndoing this about every month so if you can't make it this time check in soon.\r\n\r\nYou don't have to stay all day. Drop-ins welcome! That said, it's really fun to spend the whole time diving into it.\r\n\r\nWe're focused on Rails but we are thinking about flashmobbing other open source projects in the future. What do you want to work on?\r\n\r\nlink to contrib guide to rails\r\n\r\nrailsbridge bugmash wiki\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n","name":"Boulder BugMash","tagline":"Our next BugMash is on Saturday, August 25 11am-5pm @ Gnip's offices in Boulder.
