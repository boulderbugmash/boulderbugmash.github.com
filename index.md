### What's a BugMash?

***



If you've never been to a bug mash before, a bug mash is an event where developers of all skill levels get together and mash bugs on open source projects.

It's like an issue-solving flash mob.

Everybody gets together and picks out reported bugs in open source projects and collectively decides what we want to work on. We break into pairs and mash bugs!!! A great way to try out pair programming and find out how easy it is to get involved with open source.


We're focused on Rails but we are thinking about flashmobbing other open source projects in the future. What do you want to work on?

We are planning on doing this about every month so if you can't make it this time check in soon.




###Schedule 

***

####11-12 
Setup. Everyone gets the rails test suite running on their machines. It's helpful if you have ruby and all the dependencies already installed. If you run into trouble we can help you out.

####12-1
Lunch break

####1-5
Mashing bugs!

You don't have to stay all day. Drop-ins welcome! That said, it's really fun to spend the whole time diving into it.



###Info

***

####What do we do?

There's three main things that we look at. 

The first and easiest is looking at existing pull requests. We check to see if they apply cleanly, if they do what the author says they're supposed to, whether they have tests, and whether the behavior even makes sense to include the project.

The next thing we look at is reported issues that haven't been looked at yet. We try to reproduce the issue and if we can we try to submit a patch. This isn't always possible, but we know that in open source just showing you can reproduce an error is very helpful.

The third thing is finding issues that are either off-topic or too vague to reproduce and asking for clarification.



####I'm a beginner. Can I come? 

Absolutely! You will probably notice things the experts won't because you're thinking differently about the problem. You'll pair with someone more experienced and it's really a lot of fun.
